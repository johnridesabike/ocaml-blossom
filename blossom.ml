(** {0 Weighted maximum matching in general graphs}

    This code is based on a Python implementation by Joris van Rantwijk, who had
    consulted a C implementation by Ed Rothberg.

    Joris's comment from the Python version:
{v
> The algorithm is taken from "Efficient Algorithms for Finding Maximum
> Matching in Graphs" by Zvi Galil, ACM Computing Surveys, 1986. It is based
> on the "blossom" method for finding augmenting paths and the "primal-dual"
> method for finding a matching of maximum weight, both due to Jack Edmonds.
> Some ideas came from the "Implementation of algorithms for maximum matching
> in non-bipartite graphs" by H.J. Gabow, Standford Ph.D. thesis, 1973.
>
> Many terms used in the comments (sub-blossom, T-vertex) come from the paper
> by Galil; read the paper before reading this code.
